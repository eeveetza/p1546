% How to use:
% 
% 1) by invoking only the first nine required input arguments:
% 
%   [E, L] = P1546FieldStrMixed(f,t,heff,h2,R2,area,d_v,path_c,pathinfo);
%
% 2) by invoking optional arguments in addition to the first nine required arguments
%  using Name-Value Pair Arguments. Name is the argument name and Value is the
%  corresponding value. Name must appear inside quotes. You can specify
%  several name and value pair arguments in any order as
%  Name1,Value1,...,NameN,ValueN. 
%
%  [E, L] = P1546FieldStrMixed(f,t,heff,h2,R2,area,d_v,path_c,pathinfo, ...
%                              'q', 50, 'wa', 27, 'Ptx', 1, 'ha', 100);
%


% Examples:
%   [E, L] = P1546FieldStrMixed(2700,50,1600,1.5,10,'Suburban',20,'Land',1);
%
%   [E, L] = P1546FieldStrMixed(2700,50,1600,1.5,10,'Suburban',20,'Land',1, 'q', 50, 'wa', 27, 'Ptx', 1, 'ha', 100);

%
% This function implements ITU-R P.1546-6 recommendation,
% describing a method for point-to-area radio propagation predictions for
% terrestrial services in the frequency range 30 MHz to 4000 MHz. It is
% intended for use on tropospheric radio circuits over land paths, sea paths,
% and/or mixed land-sea paths up to 1000 km length for effective
% transmitting antenna heights less than 3000 m. The method is based on
% interpolation/extrapolation from empirically derived field-strength
% curves as functions of distance, antenna height, frequency, and percentage
% time. The caluculation procedure also includes corrections to the results
% obtained from this interpolation/extrapolation to account for terrain
% clearance, terminal clutter obstructions, and location variability.
%
% Notes:
% If sea path is selected for a t value less then 50% the default 10% table
% use is a cold sea path.
%
% Not implemented in this version of the code:
%  - Annex 7: Adjustment for different climatic regions
%  - Annex 5, Section 4.3a): C_h1 calculation (terrain database is
%  available and the potential of discontinuities around h1 = 0 is of no
%  concern)

% 4 Application of transmitting/base antenna height, h1
% The value of h1 controls which curve or curves are selected from which to 
% obtain field-strength values, and the interpolation or extrapolation 
% which may be necessary. The following cases are distinguished.

    % 4.1 Transmitting/base antenna height, h1, in the range 10 m to 3 000m
    % If the value of h1 coincides with one of the eight heights for which
    % curves are provided, namely 10, 20, 37.5, 75, 150, 300, 600 or 1 200m
    % the required field strength may be obtained directly from the plotted 
    % curves or the associated tabulations. Otherwise the required field
    % strength should be interpolated or extrapolated from field strengths

% esists between the terminals, and the field strength is calulated as the
% free-space value based on slope distance.
% If these assumptions do not fit the required short-range scenario,
% appropriate adjustments should be made to account for effects such as
% street-canyon propagation, building entry, indoor sections of path, or
% body effects.
% This extension to short distances can allow the path to have a steep
% inclination, or even be vertical if ha > h2. It is important to note that
% the predicted field strength does not take into account of the vertical
% radiation pattern of the transmitting/base antenna. The field strength
